#  HR Employee Attrition Analysis

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Power BI  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Project Description
This project analyzes employee attrition in an organization using a real-world HR dataset. The aim is to discover the key factors leading to employee resignations and provide insights that help improve retention strategies.

##  Key Objectives
- Identify which employee factors contribute to attrition
- Analyze trends across departments, job roles, and experience levels
- Study the impact of age, income, and satisfaction on turnover
- Build interactive dashboards for management insights

##  Key Insights
- High attrition observed among employees with low job satisfaction
- Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles had higher attrition rates
- Younger employees (25–35 years) are more likely to resign
- Employees with fewer years at the company tend to leave more often

##  Project Steps
1. Cleaned the dataset using Python (Pandas)
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
3. Dropped unnecessary columns like EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours
4. Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize attrition trends
